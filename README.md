# SQL-Sentence-Generator

### What it does

**SQL Sentence Generator** as it name clarifies, generates random data in SQL format (dumping it into a .sql file) for its later usage during the use of DML SQL sentences.

**!! Disclaimer !!** 
Currently the one and only feature working correctly is INSERT INTO
